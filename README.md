==========

e-Skolastik is a web service for academic profiles. Using the service instance at e-skolastik.appspot.com, you can create a home page, organize your publications, or educational material, and offer these manuscripts and related files from a single place. As different from existing alternatives, e-Skolastik allows you to host your home page at another place, create your own templates to control its presentation, and share templates with other users.
